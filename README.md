## Research Proposal: 

Pesticides Estimation and Monitoring using Remote Sensing and GIS


## Introduction:

Pesticides are used in agricultural production to reduce crop losses due to pests, weeds and diseases. However, improper use of pesticides can have adverse environmental and health effects. Remote sensing and GIS provide a cost-effective way of estimating pesticide use on a large scale. This research proposal seeks to develop a method for estimating pesticide use using remote sensing and GIS. 


## Objectives:

The main objectives of this research project are:

1. To develop a method for estimating pesticide use in agricultural fields using remote sensing and GIS data.

2. To analyze the accuracy of the method and compare it to traditional methods.

3. To assess the environmental and health impacts of pesticide use.



## Methodology


The methodology for Pesticides Estimation using Remote Sensing and GIS involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Collect all the relevant data related to Pesticides Estimation such as crop type, land use, vegetation indices, soil characteristics, etc. from multiple sources such as satellite imagery, aerial photography, and field surveys.

2. Data Pre-processing: Pre-process the collected data to make it ready for the analysis. This includes the removal of noise, missing values, and other irrelevant information.

3. Data Processing: Use digital image processing techniques to extract relevant information from the pre-processed data. This includes the calculation of vegetation indices, spectral indices, and other indices to identify and quantify pesticide levels.

4. GIS Analysis: Use GIS to analyze the digital image data and to generate meaningful maps and other visualizations.

5. Results Interpretation: Interpret the results obtained from the GIS analysis and use them to generate meaningful insights into the pesticide levels.

6. Report Generation: Generate a comprehensive report that summarizes the findings of the analysis.


## Steps 

1. Collect high-resolution satellite imagery, such as Landsat 8 or Sentinel-2, for the area of interest.

2. Use GIS software to create a land cover map of the area of interest.

3. Extract spectral information from the satellite imagery and use it to identify areas with potential pesticide use.

4. Use GIS software to create a map of the potential pesticide use areas.

5. Use field sampling techniques to measure the concentration of pesticides in the soil and water.

6. Correlate the field sample data with the satellite imagery to identify areas with high pesticide use.

7. Use GIS software to create a map of the areas with high pesticide use.

8. Use other sources of information, such as public health records and agricultural production data, to confirm the presence of pesticides in the area.

9. Use GIS software to create a final map of the areas with highest pesticide use.



## Timeline

The research project is expected to take 12 months to complete. The timeline for each stage is as follows:

1. Literature review: 3 months.

2. Data collection: 3 months.

3. Method development: 3 months.

4. Validation of the method: 3 months.

5. Analysis of environmental and health impacts: 3 months.


## Conclusion:

This research project seeks to develop a method for estimating pesticide use using remote sensing and GIS. The method will be validated using traditional methods and the environmental and health impacts of pesticide use will be analyzed. The project is expected to take 12 months to complete.
